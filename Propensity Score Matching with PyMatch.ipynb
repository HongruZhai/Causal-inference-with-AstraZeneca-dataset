    "In the pursuit of causal insights, ideally experimental settings are needed. However in real life, randomized control trial (RCT) is oftentime not possible or expensive. Real world evidence, on the other hand, is a rich source of observational data that is easy to obtain. Case-control study enables us to draw causal inference in an inexpensive way, where matching techniques like *propensity score matching* come in to play. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of randomized experiment settings, matching techniques can be used to identify and compare two existing groups differing in outcome (as if \"finding\" the control and test groups), which enables the estimation of average treatment effect (ATE) from the purely observational data.

    "Here is an example of causal inference from observational data. In pharmaceutical companies, drug delivery experiments are carried out and recorded by microscopy images of the nurturing wells. After applying certain dose of drug, a successful uptake of the drug to the cell will lead to a fluorescence protein expression of the cell. All the individual cells are tracked down and features of them are observed. \n",
